Why did my repair request under Protection Plan get rejected?
The reason mentioned by you in your claim did not match our criteria of covering the protection plan. Please go through the detailed terms here (https://servify.in/termsandconditions/terms-license-eula/).
The date of purchase provided by you did not match the date provided during activation of plan.
Your phone was found to be either already serviced by an unauthorised center or refurbished. This is against the policy laid out by the brand.
These are only a handful of scenarios where repair requests get rejected. To know more, visit our documentation page (https://servify.in/termsandconditions/terms-license-eula/).
Activation code not received, what to do?
Please ensure you are using the correct device to register for the said plan. The activation code is sent via sms and email to our users on the registered email address and phone number.
What is depreciation and why applicable ?
Every product, once sold, loses value. The car that you brought a year ago or even a week ago will lose value once it leaves the showroom. As products are prone to wear and tear, it is safe to assume the value of it will keep dropping once it is sold. And since a phone is always subject to constant use throughout the day, one excepts several dents or dumps over its lifecycle. The same principle applies for cars as well.
No update on repair status or long pending OR different repair statuses?
I’m sorry you are unable to get a correct status on your repair request. As I can see from our records, you had submitted a request for your <device name> on the <date> for a <describe issue>. Usually, our process takes <ETA> to resolve such cases.
